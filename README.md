# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Welcome to my Github profile! My name is Jonathan Bout and I'm from The Netherlands. Since the beginning of 2022, I've been working on a variety of projects, ranging from games developed with Unity to li'l projects with Arduino and even web servers hosted on a Raspberry Pi and an Odroid.

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
Twitter is linked in my profile.

## Interests

I enjoy keeping up with the space industry and its new technology, in addition to coding. It's always exciting to see a rocket launch! :rocket::star:
