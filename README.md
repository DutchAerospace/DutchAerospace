## üëã Hello there!
I am Jonathan Bout, from The Netherlands.
### The beginning of my journey
Around the middle of 2020 I started my programming journy by installing the Unity Editor. After some tutorials and a lot of copypasta I built some simple games, like pong or an endless runner, and gradually learned the programming language C#.
### Dotnet Framework
After a while I started experimenting with C# without the Unity Editor and was amazed by the compilation times. Shortly after that, I completely ditched Unity. I then started making WinForms apps which I quite liked, although I missed something.
### Moar platforms
Then I found out about .NET MAUI and Xamarin. Because MAUI wasn't that good yet, I chose to start with Xamarin and wait for an official MAUI release. Around that time I also started experimenting with Arduino, which later grew to a Raspberry Pi 3. After a while I got an Odroid N2+, which is a bit more performant.
### Webdevelopment
On those Linux devices I made some simple websites using raw HTML and CSS and Apache. Something I did not really like about that that was the need to use JavaScript so I tried ASP.NET Core with Blazor and I like it!

(most of the code in other languages is not displayed here because i've not made the repos public)

### In Short
- I am used to C#, but I have also learnt Javascript (üí©), Python (:snake:), a bit of C++ (Arduino) and Shell (:shell:) scripts.
- In terms of UI I have some experience with HTML, CSS, Razor pages, WinForms, Xamarin and MAUI.
- I've experience with Unity, but don't use it anymore because of the editor's speed (or slownessüêå).
- Currently building and managing ASP.NET websites, first hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, now an Odroid N2+.

And by the way I also like watching the (aero)space Industry :airplane::rocket::star:
