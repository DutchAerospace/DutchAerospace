  
# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

<div align=center>
Welcome to my Github profile! My name is Jonathan Bout and I'm from The Netherlands. Since I started programming in early 2020 I have made several projects, ranging from games developed with Unity to small projects with Arduino and even web servers hosted on a Raspberry Pi and later an [Odroid N2+](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-n2/odroid-n2). At the moment I'm managing some small Dutch websites, one with WordPress and another one with Blazor and starting September 2023 I am a student informatica at Hogeschool Rotterdam.

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
Twitter is linked in my profile.

## Interests

I enjoy keeping up with the space industry and its new technology, in addition to coding. It's always exciting to see a rocket launch into space! :rocket::star:
