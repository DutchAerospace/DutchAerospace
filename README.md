### 👋 Hi there!
I am Jonathan Bout, from The Netherlands.
- I am used to C#, but I have also learnt Javascript, Python, a bit of C++ (Arduino) and Shell scripts.
- In terms of UI I have some experience with HTML, CSS, Razor pages, WinForms, Xamarin and MAUI.
- I've experience with Unity (stopped using it because it is slow 🐌)
- Currently building and managing websites, first hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, now an Odroid N2+
- You can reach me via Twitter ([@BoutJonathan](https://twitter.com/BoutJonathan)) or Instagram ([@Dutch_Space](https://www.instagram.com/dutch_space/))
