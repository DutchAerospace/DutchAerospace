## 👋 Hello there!
I am Jonathan Bout, from The Netherlands.
Since 2020 I've been coding all sorts of things, from games (with Unity) to robots (with Arduino) or webservers (with Raspberry Pi).

(most of the code in other languages is not displayed here because i've not made the repos public)

### In Short
- I am used to C#, but I have also learnt Javascript (💩), Python (:snake:), and a bit of C++ (with Arduino) and Shell (:shell:) scripts.
- In terms of UI I have some experience with HTML, CSS, Razor pages, WinForms, Xamarin and MAUI.
- I have experience with Unity, but don't use it anymore because of the editor's speed (or slowness🐌).
- Currently building and managing ASP.NET websites, first hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, now an Odroid N2+.

And by the way I also like watching the (aero)space Industry :airplane::rocket::star:
