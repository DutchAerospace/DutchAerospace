## 👋 Hello there!
I am Jonathan Bout, from The Netherlands.
Since 2020 I've been coding all sorts of things, from games (with Unity) to robots (with Arduino) or webservers (with Raspberry Pi).

- I am used to C#, but I have also learnt Javascript (💩), Python (:snake:), and a bit of C++ (with Arduino) and Shell (:shell:) scripts.<br/>
- In terms of UI I have some experience with HTML, CSS, Razor pages, WinForms, Xamarin and MAUI.<br/>
- I have experience with Unity, but don't use it anymore because of the editor's speed (or slowness🐌).<br/>
- Currently building and managing ASP.NET websites, first hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, now an Odroid N2+.<br/>

And by the way I also like watching the spaceflight industry :airplane::rocket::star:
