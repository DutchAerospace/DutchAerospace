### üëã Hello there!
I am Jonathan Bout, from The Netherlands.
#### The beginning of my journey
Around the end of 2021 I started my programming journey by installing the Unity Editor. After some tutorials and a lot of `ctrl+c Ctrl+v` I built some simple games, like pong or an endless runner.
#### 'Raw' C#
After a while I started experimenting with C# console apps without the Unity Editor and was amazed by the compilation times. Shortly after that, I completely ditched Unity. I then started making WinForms apps which I quite liked.
#### Moar platforms
Then I found out about .NET MAUI and Xamarin. Because MAUI wasn't that good yet, I chose to start with Xamarin and wait for an official MAUI release. Around that time I also started experimenting with Arduino, which later grew to a Raspberry Pi 3.
#### Webdevelopment
There I made some simple websites using raw HTML and CSS and Apache. What I not really likeed about that was the use of JavaScript. I started searching for a way to replace the JS with C# and found it: razor pages. That is exactly where I am right now.
#### In Short
- I am used to C#, but I have also learnt Javascript (üí©), Python (:snake:), a bit of C++ (Arduino) and Shell (:shell:) scripts.
- In terms of UI I have some experience with HTML, CSS, Razor pages, WinForms, Xamarin and MAUI.
- I've experience with Unity, but don't use it anymore because of the editor's speed (or slownessüêå).
- Currently building and managing websites, first hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, now an Odroid N2+.
